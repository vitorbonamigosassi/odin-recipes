        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe feeds a lot of people and it's a cinch to toss together. I took it to a potluck and the pan came
            home licked clean, literally! People were going back for seconds and thirds, and they were disappointed when
            it was all gone. These potatoes are so good, you just can't stop eating them! They go great with chicken,
            beef, or pork. Halve the recipe for a family of four.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 (32 ounce) package frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) container sour cream</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided, or more to taste</li>
            <li>8 slices cooked bacon, crumbled</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>Mix hash browns, sour cream, 1 cup Cheddar, bacon, and ranch mix together in a large bowl until well
                combined. Spread into the prepared pan and cover with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle remaining Cheddar evenly across
                potatoes. Bake until cheese is bubbly and lightly browned around the edges, about 15 more minutes.</li>
        </ol>
