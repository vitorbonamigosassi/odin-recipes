        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Meat:</b> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
            <li><b>Onion and garlic:</b> An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Tomato products:</b> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
            <li><b>Sugar:</b> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
            <li><b>Spices and seasonings:</b> This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
            <li><b>Lasagna noodles:</b> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
            <li><b>Cheeses:</b> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
            <li><b>Egg:</b> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How long to cook lasagna</h2>
        <p>The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F.
